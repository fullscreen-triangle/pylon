RESEARCH DISCLAIMER:

This software implements experimental theoretical concepts in gear ratio-based
hierarchical networks and transcendent observer architectures. The mathematical
foundations are novel and should be validated independently before use in
production systems.

The framework is designed for research and validation purposes. While the
implementation follows rigorous mathematical principles, the theoretical
foundations are subject to ongoing research and refinement.

Users should exercise appropriate caution and perform independent validation
when considering these concepts for practical applications.
